📌 Overview
This project is a technology-driven food optimization platform designed to enhance food security, reduce waste, and empower farmers. It provides AI-powered demand prediction, a marketplace for direct trade, waste management solutions, and smart farming education to optimize agricultural supply chains.

🚀 Features & Real-World Impact
1️⃣ Demand Prediction 📊

Problem: Farmers often grow crops without knowing market demand, leading to surplus (wastage) or deficit (price hikes).
